<h1>Harry potter</h1>
<h3>by j.k.rowling</h3>
<p>  a book about bravery and courage. As Professor Albus Dumbledore, 
    the Headmaster at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, says “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies,
     but just as much to stand up to our friends.”
    I enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it for muggles aged eleven and up. 
    This is the first in the seven book Harry Potter series. I think readers must read 
    Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone before reading the other books in the series,
     as this book sets the scene for the Harry Potter world.</p>

            <h1>kafka on the shore</h1>
            <h3> by haruki murakami</h3>
            <p>a tour de force of metaphysical reality, 
                is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, 
                who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to 
                search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata,
                 who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that,
                  like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom.</p>

            <h1>sherlock holmes</h1>
            <h3>by Arthur Conan Doyle</h3>
            <p>the series of short stories that made the fortunes of the Strand magazine, 
                in which they were first published, and won immense popularity for Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. 
                The detective is at the height of his powers and the volume is full of famous cases, including 
                'The Red-Headed League', 'The Blue Carbuncle', and 'The Speckled Band'.
                 Although Holmes gained a reputation for infallibility, Conan Doyle showed his own realism and
                  feminism by having the great detective defeated by Irene Adler - the woman -
                   in the very first story, 'A Scandal in Bohemia'.</p>

            <h1>ender's game</h1>
            <h3> by Orson Scott Card</h3>
            <p>Andrew "Ender" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games;
                 he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation,
                  Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to
                   destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip 
                   away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. 
                   He will grow up fast.</p>

        <p>J.K. Rowling sits down with Matt Lauer to talk about her charity, Lumos, 
            and the future of Harry Potter.
            Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965. Dianne, her younger sister, 
            was born almost two years later and Joanne’s earliest childhood memory is 
            of Dianne’s arrival. She, her sister and her parents lived in Winterbourne,
             Gloucestershire, until Joanne was nine, when the family moved to Tutshill.
