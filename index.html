            <h4>Men Without Women</h4>
            <p>Across seven tales, Haruki Murakami brings his powers of observation to bear on the lives of men who,
                 in their own ways, find themselves alone. Here are lovesick doctors, students, ex-boyfriends, actors,
                  bartenders, and even Kafka’s Gregor Samsa, brought together to tell stories that speak to us all.
                In Men Without Women Murakami has crafted another contemporary classic, marked by the same wry humor 
                and pathos that have defined his entire body of work</p><br>
                <p><i>"Mesmerizing…Haruki Murakami is a master of the open-ended mystery."</i>
                    -The Washington Post</p><br>
                    <h4>Excerpt</h4>
                    <p>The call came in after one a.m. and woke me up. Phones ringing in the middle of the night
                         always sound harsh and grating, like some savage metal tool out to destroy the world.
                          I felt it was my duty, as a member of the human race, to put a stop to it, so I got out of bed, 
                          padded over to the living room, and picked up the receiver.
                        A man’s low voice informed me that a woman had vanished from this world forever.
                         The voice belonged to the woman’s husband. At least that’s what he said. And he went on. 
                         My wife committed suicide last Wednesday, he said. In any case, I thought I should let you know.
                          In any case. As far as I could make out, there was not a drop of emotion in his voice. 
                          It was like he was reading lines meant for a telegram, with barely any space at all between each word. 
                          An announcement, pure and simple. Unadorned reality. Period.</p>

    <h1>Why a book club</h1>
    <p>English classes in highschool may have forced you to talk about boring books you really
         didn’t want to read in the first place, but it’s surprising how this can actually be
          a interesting activity when done voluntarily! Discussing the wider themes and character
           arcs of a story can give you a new perspective on reading, and actually allows you to
           gain more out of books than you did before. You aren’t just reading for entertainment, but
            rather to learn something insightful about yourself or our society at large.
             And when you aren’t doing something for a grade, the friendly informal setting means
              you can voice your thoughts without being worried they might be wrong. </p>
